WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   s1/i8259/eoir[4]_GND_64_o_equal_97_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data
   into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net xiow_n is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net s9/i8255/pds is sourced by
   a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net icon_control0<13> is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net irq0 is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   s8/i8253/vcs/C1/READ/MODE[5]_PWR_153_o_Mux_9_o is sourced by a combinatorial
   pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading
   of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   s4/wrt_dma_pg_reg_n_INV_739_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
