To make this sound module work, you just need to hook up
to any type of pc amplified speaker or whatever. I recommend
this hook up to get started. If you want something fancier,
take a look at the schematics in my ZBC repository


                    1k resistor
 GPIO Pin  0---------/\/\/\/\-----+----------------------> to amplifier input
                                  |
                                  |
                                  |
                                  - .1uf capacitor
                                  -
                                  |
                                  +----------------------> to amplifier ground
                                  |
                                  |
                                  _ GPIO gnd


That is it, if you want stereo, do 2 of these.
