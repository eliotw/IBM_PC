Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice LUTs:                          6 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                        6 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:               6

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     5 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:            6
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             6 out of       6  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of       6    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of       6    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  69,120    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        13 out of     640    2%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       13 out of      13  100%

Specific Feature Utilization:

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.07

Peak Memory Usage:  964 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  10 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   10 secs
