<msg type="warning" file="Place" num="644" delta="old" >A clock IOB clock component is not placed at an optimal clock IOB site. The clock IOB component &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">KEYBOARD_CLK</arg>&gt; is placed at site &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">T26</arg>&gt;. The clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer/GCLK if the IOB is placed in the master Clock IOB Site. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="3">KEYBOARD_CLK.PAD</arg>&gt; allowing your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.
