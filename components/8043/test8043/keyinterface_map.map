Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    69 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  69
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         60 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                       59 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              59
    Number used as Memory:                       1 out of  17,920    1%
      Number used as Shift Register:             1
        Number using O6 output only:             1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    45 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          101
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            32 out of     101   31%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  41 out of     101   40%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          28 out of     101   27%
    Number of unique control sets:              28
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              78 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        14 out of     640    2%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      2 out of      32    6%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        2

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.44

Peak Memory Usage:  1000 MB
